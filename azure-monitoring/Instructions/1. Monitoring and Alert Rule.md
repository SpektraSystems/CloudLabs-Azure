# Challenge 1: Monitoring and Alert Rule Challenge	

1. Create an empty database called `tpcc` on the `SQL Server`
  * SQL Server Credential:
     * Username: `sqladmin`
     * Password: `demopass!123`
2. Using `AZ CLI`, `Powershell` or `ARM template`, send the below guest `OS` metric to Azure Monitor for the `SQL Server`
3. Add a Performance Counter Metric for
  * Object: `SQLServer:Databases`
  * Counter: `Active Transactions`
  * Instance: `tpcc`
  * Download and Install `HammerDB` tool on the `Visual Studio VM` (instructions are in your `Student\Guides\Day-1` folder for setting up and using Hammerdb.
  * www.hammerdb.com
5. Use `HammerDB` to create transaction load
6. From `Azure Monitor`, create a graph for the `SQL Server Active Transactions` and `Percent CPU` and pin to your Azure Dashboard
7. From `Azure Monitor`, create an Action group, to send email to your address
8. Create an Alert if `Active Transactions` goes over `40` on the SQL Server `tpcc` database
9. Create an `Alert Rule` for `CPU` over `75%` on the Virtual Scale Set that emails me when you go over the threshold
  * Note: In the `Student\Resources\Loadscripts` folder you will find a CPU load script to use
  
#### First team to send me both alerts wins the challenge!! Good luck!
