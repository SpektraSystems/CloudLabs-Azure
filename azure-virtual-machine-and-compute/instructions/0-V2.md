Now you're all set to explore the powerful world of technology. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions along the way. Enjoy your workshop!

## **Scenario 1 - Building a Virtual Network**
An **Azure virtual network** (VNet) is a representation of your own **network**  in the cloud. It is a logical isolation of the **Azure** cloud dedicated to your subscription. You can fully control the IP address blocks, DNS settings, security policies and route tables within this **network.** [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview).

### **Building a Virtual Network**

1. Click on **+ Create a resource**.

2. In the search box, type **Virtual Network** and select to open it.

     ![Create Resource](https://github.com/SpektraSystems/CloudLabs-Azure/blob/master/azure-virtual-machine-and-compute/instructions/images/vnet.png?raw=true)
     
3. Click on the **Create** button.

      ![create vnet](https://github.com/SpektraSystems/CloudLabs-Azure/blob/master/azure-virtual-machine-and-compute/instructions/images/vnet-create.png?raw=true)
      
4. On the **Create virtual network** blade, enter the following information:
    
    -  Subscription: **Select your subscription (1)**.
    
    -  Resource group: Select the exisiting resource group named **azvmrg-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)**
    
    -  Name: **DemoLabVnet1 (3)**
    
    > **Note:** If the portal advises the name is not unique, simply adjust the name. Once you create a unique name that is available, you will see a check mark at the end of the **Name** field.

    -  Region: Select the region you are using to perform the lab **(4)**.

    -  Click on **Next (5)**

7.  On **Add subnet** tab enter the following details and click **Add (3)**.
   
      - Name: **demolabsubnet (1)**
      
      - Subnet address range: **10.2.0.0 (2)**
      
      - Subnet size : Select **/26(64 addresses) (3)** from the drop down.
      
      - Click on **Add Subnet**.
