# Lab 07 - Azure Monitor

### Estimated Duration: 35 Minutes

## Overview
 
In this lab, you will configure Azure Monitor to track the performance of a Windows Server virtual machine running in Azure. By collecting and analyzing telemetry data, you will gain insights into system health and resource utilization. Specifically, you will monitor the VM’s CPU usage, adjust the time range to view recent activity, and interpret the results to identify performance trends.

## Lab Objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Monitor VM CPU Performance with Azure Monitor

## Task 1: Monitor VM CPU Performance with Azure Monitor

In this task, you will use Azure Monitor to track CPU utilization for a specific virtual machine, adjust the time range to the last 30 minutes, and review performance trends to identify potential issues proactively.
