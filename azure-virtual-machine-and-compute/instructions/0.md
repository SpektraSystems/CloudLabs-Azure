# Lab 01: Building a Virtual Network

## Estimated Duration: 30 Minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you will build and configure an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) to establish a secure and isolated networking environment for future application deployments. You will define custom IP address ranges, create a dedicated subnet, and configure network settings through the Azure portal. This VNet will provide the foundation for hosting virtual machines, application services, and other Azure resources, enabling controlled connectivity and ensuring alignment with organizational networking requirements.

## Lab Objective

You will be able to complete the following task:

- Task 1: Building a Virtual Network

## Task 1: Building a Virtual Network

In this task, you will create an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) in the Azure portal by configuring basic settings, defining IP address space, and creating a subnet to establish a secure, isolated environment for Azure services.

1. In the **Azure portal**, under **Azure services**, click on **+ Create a resource**.
