# Getting Started with Lab

1. Once the environment is provisioned, a virtual machine (HyperVHostServer) on the left and lab guide on the right will get loaded in your browser. Use this virtual machine throughout the workshop to perform the lab. 

 > **Note**: We will be referring this Virtual Machine as HyperVHost server or Jump VM throughout the lab.

2. To access the lab environment details, you can select **Lab Environment** tab as shown in the image below. Additionally, you will receive the credentials to the registered email address. If you don't see that in Inbox, check you spam folder as well.

# Review the App

In this exercise you will review the ContosoIT web application, log a ticket with the web application and review the Hyper-V setup to validate your on-premises resources.  The goal here is to just get a sense that this is a real working application that we are going to migrate.

### Detailed steps

1. On the Desktop of your HyperVHost server, click on the **ContosoIT** shortcut and wait for the website **contosoit.contoso.com** to load.  This is a support ticket site for the Contoso company that we'll be moving.

2. Once the page loads, **click** on **Create New** to create a new ticket .

3. Fill out the ticket form and **click** on **Create**. Then select **Assign** from the options available.	

4. Minimise the browser and **click** on Windows Search button on the lower left corner.

5. Type **CMD** on the Search bar and select the App **Command Prompt** in the search results to open the command prompt.

6. Type the following command **ping contosoit.contoso.com** and hit **Enter**.

      >This is the address of the web app and resolves to **10.0.0.100** which is the on-prem IP for the webapp01 VM running on Hyper-V.

7. Minimize the command prompt and browser if not already and then **click** on **Hyper-V Manager** from the desktop. Review the application infrastructure.

	>The jumphost you are logged into is also a Hyper-V server running the infrastructure for our web app. When you click on the host name in Hyper-V manager, **<inject key="jumphostVmName" />** you will see 3 guest VM's:
     	>*  **migratenext** - Pre-deployed Azure Migrate Appliance
     	>*  **webapp01** - Windows 2008R2 Server running IIS and hosting ContosoIT web application
     	>*  **webmssql01** - Windows 2008R2 Server with SQL 2008R2 hosting the ContosoIT database
