# Configure Appliance

In the previous steps you set up the Azure side of the Migrate solution and ended at the point you would download and install the on-prem components.  In this exercise you will configure the on-prem appliance and kick off a discovery to assess in Azure.

### Tips:

  * We downloaded and pre-staged the Azure Migrate appliance in advance to save time.  You will pick up with the appliance already running in Hyper-V ready for configuration.
  * To paste values in the VM console in Hyper-V, after you copy something to the clipboard click **Clipboard** from the console menu and select **Type clipboard text**


### Configure Appliance

1. Minimize the browser and bring up the **Hyper-V Manager** Console
2. Double-click  the **migratenext** VM

	>If the VM is locked, click the **Keyboard keys** icon in the top left or **Action** and **Ctrl+Alt+Del** and sign in with the following password: **LetsMigrate2019!**

3. Once the system console loads it will automatically launch  the **AzureMigrate WebPortal**

	>If the Migrate page does not load automatically you can launch it from the desktop

4. Accept license terms and Click **Continue**

	>If the page gets stuck on installing updates or it prompts for any windows credential, simply close and reopen the <strong>Azure Migrate Web Portal</strong>shortcut in Desktop
	
5. Sign in to Azure with the following credentials

	* **Username:** <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail" />
	* **Password:** <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword" />
    >If it prompts for any windows credential, simply close and reopen the <strong>Azure Migrate Web Portal</strong>shortcut in Desktop and perform step 4 again
    
6. Once logged in, click the **Subscription** dropdown
7. Select your subscription: **<inject key="subscriptionName" />**
8. Select your Migrate project: **<copy><inject key="resourceGroupName"  copy="false" />migrate</copy>**
1. **Enter Appliance Name: **<copy>mig<inject key="resourceGroupName"  copy="false" /></copy>**
1. Click **Register**
1. After **Successfully registered**, click **Continue**

14. Under *Specify the list of Hyper-v hosts* click **Add**
15. Enter **<inject key="networkInterface" />** and click **Validate**
16. Click **Save and start discovery**
