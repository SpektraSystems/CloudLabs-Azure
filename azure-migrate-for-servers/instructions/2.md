# Exercise 2: Configure Appliance

In the previous steps you set up the Azure side of the Migrate solution and ended at the point you would download and install the on-prem components.  In this exercise, you will configure the on-prem appliance and kick off a discovery to assess in Azure.

**Tips**
  * We downloaded and pre-staged the Azure Migrate appliance in advance to save time.  You will pick up with the appliance already running in Hyper-V ready for configuration.
  * To paste values in the VM console in Hyper-V, after you copy something to the clipboard, click **Clipboard** from the console menu and select **Type clipboard text**.

1. Under *Manage credentials and discovery sources* click on **Add credentials**. Now you will be redirected to the **Add credentials** section, for the Hyper-V host credentials enter the following values and click on **Save**.
	        
      * *Friendly Name*: **HyperVAdmin**

	>Note: If you get an error while trying to initiate discovery, Go to " Register with Azure Migrate" panel and login again using the Azure Credentials and then click on **Start discovery**

	>Note: You might see this error if your azure session logged in earlier gets expired.
	
	>When you complete the setup for the first time it will take a few minutes to discover all your VMs and begin pushing data up to the portal. Once the appliance configuration completes you will be able to see the state of services and return to the portal to begin viewing assessment data. 

1. Once the appliance configuration is completed it will look similar to the below image, minimize the browser and continue with the next exercise. Click on Azure Portal to view your discovered servers.
