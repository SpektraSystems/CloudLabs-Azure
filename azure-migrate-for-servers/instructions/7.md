# Migration Validation

At this stage we have assessed our infrastructure, replicated a VM to Azure and migrated it over into an IaaS VM.  It's time to verify our app is up and happy in its new home.

### Tips:

   * When looking for the failed server, note that the test failover process will append **-test** to your Azure VM

### Verify MIgration

1. Click on the *Notification Bell* at the top of the Azure portal
2. Click on *Starting test migration of webapp01*
3. On the Replcating Machines blade verify the test migration jobs are all green
4. If the test migration has completed, click on the **Virtual Machines** in the *FAVORITES* menu on the left of the page
5. On the *Virtual machines* blade, you should see one named **webapp01-test**
6. Click on **webapp01-test**
7. On the **Overview Page** you should see the machine status is **Running**

	>Congratulations! You have successfully migrated the Windows Server 2008R2 server to an Azure IaaS VM.
