# Lab 03: Deploy a Virtual Machine

## Estimated Duration: 40 Minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you will deploy a Windows-based virtual machine in Azure using the virtual network and availability set created in earlier labs. You will configure compute, storage, and networking settings, including selecting the appropriate image, VM size, and security options. The VM will be attached to the correct subnet and enabled for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access, ensuring secure connectivity. This deployment provides a reliable, scalable, and resilient environment for hosting enterprise applications while leveraging Azure’s high-availability features.

## Lab objective

You will be able to complete the following task:

- Task 1: Deploy a Virtual Machine

## Task 1: Deploy a Virtual Machine

In this task, you will deploy a Windows Server virtual machine into the previously created availability set. This ensures the VM benefits from fault and update domain distribution, improving uptime and resilience for your workloads.

    - **Public inbound ports:** Select **Allow selected ports (13)**.

    - **Select inbound ports:** Select **RDP (3389) (14)** from the drop-down.

    - Would you like to use an existing Windows Server license? **Leave as default (15)**.

        > **Note:** If you own Windows Server licenses with active Software Assurance (SA), use Azure Hybrid Benefit to save money. [Learn More](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/hybrid-use-benefit/#services)
  
    - Click on **Next : Disks > (16)**.
  
       ![](images/avm10.png)

1. On the **Disks** tab, set the following configuration:

   - **OS disk Size:** Keep the default **Size (1)**.

   - **OS disk type:** Select **Premium SSD (locally-redundant storage) (2)**

   - Expand the **Advanced (3)** section, where you will see that **Use managed disks (4)** is checked by default.

     > **Note:** Azure Managed Disks simplifies disk management for Azure IaaS VMs by managing the storage accounts associated with the VM disks. For best performance, reliability, scalability and access control, we recommend Azure Managed Disks for most virtual machine configurations. You only have to specify the type (Premium or Standard) and the size of disk you need, and Azure creates and manages the disk for you.

    -  Click on **Next : Networking > (5)**. 

       ![](./images2/lab3-5.png)
     
1. On the **Networking** tab, set the following configurations:

    - **Virtual network:** Select the **DemoLabVnet1 (1)** from the drop-down menu.

    - **Subnet:** Verify that **demolabsubnet (2)** is selected in the  field.

    - Verify that the **Public IP (3)** address field has a status that begins with **(new)**.

       > **Note:** Use a public IP address if you want to communicate with the virtual machine from outside the virtual network. For example, if you need to RDP to the VM, you will need a public IP address. 

   - **NIC network security group:** Select **Advanced (4)**. 

   - In the **Configure network security group**, verify **(new)DEMOLABVM01-nsg (5)** is selected.

       > **Note:** A **Network Security Group (NSG)** is a collection of firewall rules that manage inbound and outbound traffic to and from your virtual machine. [Learn more.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg)

   -  Verify that **Enable accelerated networking** is **ON (6)**.
