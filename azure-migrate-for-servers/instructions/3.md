# Create groups

In this exercise you will use Azure Migrate to group systems related to your application.  You can begin grouping and assessing systems without dependency agents involved, but having that deeper knowledge will allow you to fine tune the assessment down the line as it creates higher confidence with more data points reporting back to the Migrate solution.

### Create Group
1. Switch back to the Azure Portal
2. At the top of the **Azure Migrate - Servers** blade click **Refresh**
3. Click on the number next to **Discovered servers**
1. On the **Discovered servers** page, click **Create group**
2. On the Create Group page, type **contosogroup** into the Group name field
3. In the **Add machines to the group** section select **webapp01**
4. Click **Create** at the bottom of the page
5. Close the **Discover servers** blade by clicking the **X** at the top right of the blade
6. At the top of the **Azure Migrate - Servers** blade click **Refresh**

	>The refresh for the first group may take a couple minutes.  Feel free to review other areas of the Migration Hub and return to the **Azure Migrate - Servers** page to check back.

7. Once the solution refreshes, click **Groups** in the **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment** tile
8. Click your newly created group

At this point we have a group that we can add or remove systems to, view dependency data if available and create assessments. The link under **Recommended help** above provides more information on Service Map which powers the Migrate dependency visualization.
