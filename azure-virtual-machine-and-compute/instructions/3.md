# Lab 04: Backup and Recovery

### Estimated Duration: 30 Minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you will implement Azure Backup and Recovery Services to protect a production virtual machine against data loss and outages. You will create a Recovery Services vault, configure it with an enhanced backup policy, and enable backup for the VM. This setup ensures secure, point-in-time recovery options, allowing quick restoration in case of accidental deletion, corruption, or datacenter failure. By completing this lab, you will establish a reliable backup and recovery strategy to support business continuity and disaster recovery requirements.

## Lab objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Create a Recovery Services vault
- Task 2: Enable Virtual Machine Backup
